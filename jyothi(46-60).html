        <p>Prahalad and Hamel (1990) relate the competitive success of a corporation to<br>
            its ability to identify, cultivate, and exploit its core competencies.<br>
            For these authors, competitiveness in the long-run derives from the ability to<br>
            build core competencies more rapidly and at a lower cost than the competition.<br>
            To build them, it is necessary to meld a broad range of abilities in production<br>
            and technology with competencies the enable individual deals and adapt rapidly<br>
            to new opportunities, generating competitive advantage for the corporation.<br>
            In cultivating core competencies, the corporation manages to share costs, without<br>
            needing to invest more than the competition in research and development.<br>
            Figure 2.6 represents the diversified corporation as a large tree. The trunk and<br>
            larger branches are the core products, the smaller branches are the business units;<br>
            the leaves, flowers, and fruits are the final product. The roots are core competencies,<br>
            whose function is to distribute nutrients and provide stability to the tree.<br>
            Each part of the tree determines a different plane of competition: core<br>
            competencies, core products, and final products. The battles for market<br>
            partners are engaged at each of these levels, and leadership in final products<br>
            does not imply leadership at the other levels. Being given a dominant position<br>
            in relation to core products allows a company to mold the evolution of<br>
            application and finals markets and managing to achieve economies of scale and<br>
            of scope, since the market share of core products can come from multiple<br>
            industries</p><br>
            <p><i>Figure 2.6. The Tree : a diversified corporation (adapted from Prahalad<br>
                and Hamel, 1990)</i></p>

                <hr><hr>
                <p>Core products incorporate one or more core competencies, making the link<br>
                    between core competencies and final products. These products are the key<br>
                    components of various final products and contribute to generating value in the<br>
                    final product, materializing core competencies. According to Prahalad and<br>
                    Hamel (1990), Matsushita holds 45% of the market in the manufacturing of key<br>
                    components for VCRs (core product), while its brands participation in the final<br>
                    product (Panasonic, JVC) represents 20% of the market. Another of<br>
                    Matsushita’s core products is the compressor, with 40% of the world market,<br>
                    while its participation in air conditioners and refrigerators is quite small.<br>
                    The concept of core competencies is decisive both for services and manufacturing.<br>
                    In contrast to final products that are consumed upon use, core competencies are<br>
                    enhanced when applied or shared, even though if they are not well-constructed,<br>
                    they can be lost since knowledge also deteriorates.<br>
                    Core competencies require a commitment to working on organizational fron-<br>
                    tiers, involving different business units, several levels of hierarchy and different<br>
                    functions. Consequently, the traditional concept of a corporation unnecessarily<br>
                    limits individuals’ abilities by making functional cut-offs that patchwork the<br>
                    corporation into autonomous business units, makes core competencies more<br>
                    difficult to achieve.</p>
                    <p><i><u>Identifying Core Competencies</u></i></p><br>
                    <p>According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), it is hard to build world leadership<br>
                        when based in more than five or six core competencies. Consequently, if a<br>
                        corporation has not yet managed to achieve a lean list of competencies, it can<br>
                        apply at least three tests to identify them, as follows:<br>
                        • First test: Provides access to a broad variety of markets;<br>
                        • Second test: Makes a significant contribution to the benefits perceived<br>
                        by consumers in the final product;<br>
                        • Third test: It is hard for competitors to imitate.<br>
                        To aid in this process, it is interesting to have recourse to the idea of the tree,<br>
                        extending the concept of core competencies to core products, and finally, to<br>
                        end products. To make this extension in a consistent way, it is suggested that<br>
                        the company reflect on the following questions:<br>
                        </p>
                        <hr><hr>
                        <p>• How long can competitiveness in business survive if the core competen-<br>
                            cies are not controlled?<br>
                            • How central are these core competencies, in terms of generating value for<br>
                            the client?<br>
                            • What future opportunities will be lost if these particular competencies are<br>
                            lost?<br>
                            It is important to keep in mind that the complex harmonization of individual<br>
                            technologies and abilities needed to build core competencies cannot be simply<br>
                            acquired by a competitor. It might even acquire some of the technology, but<br>
                            would not be able to duplicate the pattern of internal coordination and learning.<br>
                            Another important component for self-knowledge is to identify which generic<br>
                            strategies will permit a more adequate positioning in order to construct<br>
                            sustainable competitive advantages.</p><br>
                            <p><u><b>Generic Competitive Strategies and Positioning</b></u></p><br>
                            <p>As Porter (1979) suggests, the development of any company in a given industry<br>
                                can be broken down into two parts, the first deriving from the average<br>
                                performance of all its competitors, and the second to the company’s perfor-<br>
                                mance relative to the sector.<br>
                                The issue to be discussed in this chapter is the company’s positioning in order<br>
                                to obtain sustainable competitive advantage. This advantage should guarantee<br>
                                the company greater income that the average of the sector where it is active.<br>
                                According to Porter (1979), there are two basic kinds of competitive advan-<br>
                                tage: leadership in cost or differentiation. Besides, the scope of strategic action<br>
                                should be defined. The target can be a broader market as a target, with several<br>
                                or restricted, acting only in a specific segment.<br>
                                Based in these two dimensions, there are four possible generic strategies, as<br>
                                illustrated in the quadrants of Figure 2.7. The generic strategies are: leadership<br>
                                in cost, differentiation, focus on cost, and focus on differentiation.<br>
                                Defining a generic competitive strategy aims at establishing a favorable,<br>
                                profitable, and sustainable competitive position, against the forces that com-<br>
                                prise the competition in an industry. Not doing clear positioning in one of these<br>
                                strategies can result in inferior performance, with a high risk that the company<br>
                                </p>
                                <hr><hr>

                                <p>has an average performance because of the different trade-off of these two<br>
                                    kinds of strategies.<br>
                                    In addition, the company disposes itself to deliver two distinct types of value<br>
                                    packages for the client (cost and differentiation) or to oscillate between them<br>
                                    over time, and this can confuse its image to customers and cause it to lose<br>
                                    credibility and its reputation.<br>
                                    The alignment of all an organization’s activities around a generic strategy makes<br>
                                    its implementation easier, as well as its communication with customers, employ-<br>
                                    ees, and stockholders. Finally, when the strategic positioning is not clear and<br>
                                    the trade-offs are not made explicit, it is hard to build the needed resources,<br>
                                    creating problems with internal coordination Porter (1996). In this manner, the<br>
                                    most critical position in terms of strategic positioning is the central region, as<br>
                                    highlighted in Figure 2.7.<br>
                                    Nonetheless Deschamps and Nayak (1995) warn that this or-or type propo-<br>
                                    sition can lead to errors of interpretation called the Commodity Trap. The<br>
                                    Commodity Trap comes from an error of interpretation that associates strat-<br>
                                    egies of differentiation to small, specialized companies active in segments or<br>
                                    niches of the market, leaving it to the large companies to adopt strategies of low<br>
                                    cost.<br>
                                    Before defining the generic strategy, it is important to verify the positioning of<br>
                                    the competitors, by making a detailed structural analysis inside the industry,<br></p>
                                    <hr><hr>
                                    <p>highlighting the major strategic groups and their dimensions. Remember that the<br>
                                        essence of good strategic positioning is selecting activities that distinguish the<br>
                                        company from its competitors.<br>
                                        We stress that, in principle, the strategy of cost leadership is not intrinsically<br>
                                        better than that of differentiation or vice versa. Everything depends on the<br>
                                        external context and the unique conditions of each company!</p><br>
                                        <p><i><u>Cost Leadership</u></i></p>
                                        <p>The company that seeks leadership in cost has to focus the entire organization<br>
                                            to achieve this objective, creating a culture of low costs, working constantly to<br>
                                            reduce waste and remaining constantly attentive to the cost positions of its<br>
                                            competitors.<br>
                                            In order to obtain this advantage, the company needs to make trade-offs, such<br>
                                            as letting go of greater variety and flexibility in favor of lower costs. On the other<br>
                                            hand, this does not mean that the company that adopts this strategy will have<br>
                                            poor-quality products.<br>
                                            The corporation that competes in this strategy has to create a gap in cost<br>
                                            performance in relation to other competitors in the industry, which allows it to<br>
                                            increase margins of profit, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. If the company manages<br>
                                            to establish a level for costs which is much lower than the competition, but at<br>
                                            the same time sets off a price war, this will reduce the margins and consequently<br>
                                            its profitability. The goal is to work with costs well below average for the<br>
                                            industry but to set prices only slightly lower than the competition.</p><br>

                                            <p>Companies such as the airline GOL, are always searching in different areas,<br>
                                                involving quick in flight service, that doesn’t require preparation and facilitates<br>
                                                the later cleaning of the airplane, quick boarding and debarking procedures,<br>
                                                making equipment available more rapidly for new flights, as well as investing in<br>
                                                technology and maintenance focused on operational efficiency.<br>
                                                The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken up when competitors are<br>
                                                able to quickly overcome the gap, eroding the bases for cost leadership, or<br>
                                                when technology changes, eliminating advantages of scale, for example.<br>
                                                </p>
                                                <p><i><u>Differentiation</i></p></u>
                                                <p>The rationale for a generic strategy of differentiation is also to increase the<br>
                                                    company margin starting from the price variable, not the cost variable<br>
                                                    The goal of the companies that compete for differentiation is to identify and<br>
                                                    satisfy customers’ needs, but those needs for which the client is inclined to pay<br>
                                                    a premium price. Therefore, the greater viability obtained in this business profile<br>
                                                    derives form the price premium. This does not mean, however, that companies<br>
                                                    that compete with this generic strategy can disregard the price variable. Once<br>
                                                    the target for differentiation has been defined, only costs associated to<br>
                                                    differentiation can be absorbed. In other aspects, the company should also<br>
                                                    exercise careful daily cost management, if it doesn’t, it will be eliminating the<br>
                                                    margin obtained from the premium price with excessive costs as illustrated in<br>

                                                        Results of competitive advantage in differentiation usually lead to investments<br>
                                                        in innovation and technology, always with the focus on the specific needs of the<br>
                                                        customers which add value, as well as the use of more specialized labor who<br>

                                                        The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken when the competitors are<br>
                                                        able to quickly manage to imitate the target of differentiation offering very<br>

                                                        changes in the environment. For this reason, these companies have to be always<br>
                                                        in motion, improving performance and innovating more rapidly than their<br>
                                                        competitors.<br>
                                                        This strategy implies higher risks, since the target of differentiation chosen by<br>
                                                        the company will not be able to obtain a premium price. In this case, the<br>
                                                        company will have costs higher than the industry average, without being able to<br>
                                                        charge more for its extra costs, since customers don’t see value in the package<br>
                                                        offered. This happened with several retail companies that decided to differen-<br>

                                                        value, since the average consumer hasn’t even got a computer, and they<br>

                                                        <p>The generic strategy of focus, on cost as well as differentiation, has many things<br>
                                                            in common with the strategies of cost leadership and differentiation, respec-<br>

                                                            The key to this strategy is to find the lucrative, sustainable target segment to<br>
                                                            exercise the strategy, whether of cost or differentiation. This focus on a segment<br>
                                                            allows the company to develop performance superior to its competitors, who<br>
                                                            have multiple targets. This segmentation can be a function of a geographic cut,<br>
                                                            or of scale, or an activity that reaches a specific type of consumer.<br>
                                                            Once the target segment has been selected, the company has to devote all its<br>

                                                            market. To have greater success in selecting the segment to implement the<br>
                                                            strategy of focus, segments that are more needy than others must be prioritized.<br>
                                                            As with the strategy of differentiation, here the risks are also high since in<br>

    <p ><h4><b><u>Case Study: Strategy and
     &nbsp;  &nbsp; Decisions in Perspective</p></b></h4></u>
     <p><u><b><h5>Case – Competition in the Automobile Industry</h5></b></u></p>
     <p>Auto assembly plants engaged in much more respectful competition in the past<br>
        than now. Partnerships such as Autolatina in Brazil, shared between Volkswagen<br>
        and Ford, from 1987 to 1995, were viable in the closed market, but ceased to<br>
        be so with the opening of commerce. The number of competitors with plants in<br>
        the country multiplied, from those already installed before the opening, GM,<br>
        Fiat, and Toyota, to those of the French – Renault, Peugeot, and Citroën; and<br>
        the Japanese with Honda. Presently the majority of models produced in Brazil<br>
        are of European origin.<br>
        To aggravate the situation, the automotive industry began to experience slow<br>
        growth during that period, which led to even sharper competition.<br>
        The assemblers depended more on the supply of components produced and<br>
        supplied by the first tier suppliers, with higher added value, which related to<br>
        second and third level tiers in the supply chain, who manufactured sub-sets and<br>
        individual components.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b><h5><u>Case – Analysis of Competition in Belem</u></h5></b></p>
        <p>The absence of large Brazilian retail chains in the city of Belém, in the Amazon<br>
            State, is due to difficulties in meeting the specifics of the local market and the<br>
            complexity of supplying it.<br>
            </p>
            <hr><hr>
            <p>In the 1980s, the Pão de Açúcar Group, the largest supermarket chain in Brazil,<br>
                was the largest major supermarket chain present in Belém, but ended up<br>
                beating a retreat during the group’s restructuring. The Bom-Preço channel also<br>
                gave up fighting over Belem´s consumers, closing 10 stores in 1993.<br>
                Local groups were very aggressive in defending their territory, balancing<br>
                modernizing of their stores with their regional roots. Peculiarities of local<br>
                demand are very marked. Regional customs make the residents of Belem very<br>
                particular consumers of things such as vegetables typical of the region, such as<br>
                jambu, bacuri, cupuaçu, teperebá, or uxi, and the substitution of fresh milk with<br>
                powdered milk. Imagine the effort needed to supply customized products for<br>
                department stores or supermarkets in this city!<br>
                Due to their good knowledge of the characteristics of the local market, the local<br>
                retail groups, such as Yamada, Leader, and Visão have managed to hold their<br>
                own. Among the major retail chains in the country, only C&A, Arapuã,<br>
                Riachuelo, and Lojas Americanas dispute the local market.<br>

                <p>The bologna market in metropolitan São Paulo, Brazil, is highly competitive.<br>
                    The main players are six high competitive companies with strong local brands:<br>
                    Cardeal, Ceratti, Marba, Rezende, Sadia, and Perdigão.<br>
                    Two pressure maps were drawn and each diagram is a picture of the São<br>
                    Paulo’s bologna market for each period analyzed. For the studied industry, it<br>
                    was assumed that the importance of the market (I.M.) was the percentage of<br>
                    bologna in the company’s total revenue and the size of the incursion (S.I.) was<br>
                    the market share achieved reached by each analyzed player.<br>
                    The strongest pressure ordinarily gets the quickest or the most effective<br>
                    response. Figure 2.10 shows a competitive pressures map, which represents<br>
                    the beginning of a great offensive movement of Ceratti over its stronger<br>
                    competitor, Marba, with significant reflexes on the others. It seems that Marba<br>
                    did not make any effort to avoid the imminent aggression from Ceratti.<br>
                    Figure 2.11 shows a significant expressive retaliation by Marba over Ceratti for<br>
                    the purpose of recovering its market share. Cardeal also made sales efforts to<br>
                    gain market shares from Ceratti, Sadia, and Perdigão. Apparently, Perdigão<br>

                        <p><i><h5><u>Case – Building Competencies at NEC</i></p></h5></u>
                        <p>At the end of the 1980s, NEC emerged as a leader in the area of semiconductors<br>
                            and as one of the major competitors in producing telecommunications and<br>
                            computers. In addition to consolidating its position in mainframes for computers and<br>
                            acting in the areas of public commuters and transmitters, it began to produce<br>
                            products for everyday use such as cell phones, faxes, laptops — linking<br>
                            telecommunications and office automation.</p><br>
                            <hr><hr>
                            <p>NEC is the only company among the five major revenues in telecommunications,<br>
                                semiconductors, and mainframes industries.<br>
                                In the beginning of the 1970s, NEC articulated a strategy to explore the convergence<br>
                                of computers with communications, which was called “C&C.” The success of this<br>
                                management strategy resulted in the acquisition of competencies, especially in<br>
                                semiconductors. NEC formed the “C&C Committee” composed of high-level<br>
                                executives to supervise the development of its core products and core competencies<br>
                                alongside its individual business interests. In accordance with its strategic structure,<br>
                                NEC transferred enormous resources to fortify its position in components and<br>
                                central processors. By employing collaborative arrangements to multiply its internal<br>
                                resources, NEC was ready to accumulate a vast range of core competencies.<br>
                                NEC carefully identified three channels for technological evolution and interrelated<br>
                                markets, involving things from its large mainframes to distribution processes,<br>
                                components from simple ICs to VSLI, and communications from mechanical<br>
                                exchange bars to complex digital systems that we now call ISDN. Finally, NEC<br>
                                determined that semiconductors would be its most important product.<br>
                                To build up its competencies rapidly and at low cost, NEC got involved in numerous<br>
                                numbers of strategic alliances, which numbered over 100 just in 1987. In<br>
                                mainframes, the best-known alliance was with Honeywell and Bull. Almost all the<br>
                                arrangements in the area of semiconductors and components were oriented toward<br>
                                access to technology. The research director at NEC summed up this acquisition of<br>
                                competencies during the 1970s and 1980s thusly, “From the point of view of<br>
                                investment, it was much cheaper and quicker to use outside technology. There was<br>
                                no need for us to develop new ideas.”<br>

                                        The total profit on other operations — pulled by the fertilizer area — was about<br>
                                        60 million dollars “Despite the slips in the consumer areas, the group has been<br>
                                        very successful with its strategy in the area of commodities and fertilizers,” says<br>
                                        Luciana Massaad, investment analyst for the Itaú Bank.<br>
                                        The solution to problems caused by maintaining a division foreign to Bunge’s<br>
                                        focus has to do with the challenge of valorizing Santista Foods and Sears,<br>
                                        separating out the businesses that are of interest to the group, integrating them<br>
                                        into the global strategy, and selling off the rest, preferably for a good price.<br>
                                        Many of Bunge’s difficulties with the consumer area come from the group’s<br>
                                        traditional vocation in the area of agricultural commodities. This has been the<br>
                                        group’s area of competency since 1818, when it founded the Koninklijke<br>
                                        Bunge in Amsterdam to import grain from the Dutch colonies. Looking for<br>
                                        wheat, Bunge arrived in Argentina in 1874. In 1906 it landed in Brazil, acquiring<br>
                                        Moinho Santista. During periods of prosperity for wheat, the food group began<br>
                                        to develop around these mills, which became accustomed to large volume<br>
                                        business. The executives trained at Bunge were never close to the consumer<br>
                                        market as were the teams from companies such as Unilever, one of the<br>
                                        principals of Santista Alimentos in the area of margarine and mayonnaise. Until<br>
                                        a short while ago, sales personnel spoke of tons of bread sold and not in units,<br>
                                        as this is normally referred to in other consumer goods companies. “We will<br>
                                        never be like a Unilever or Nestlé in terms of brand name management,” says<br>
                                        Weisser.<br>
                                        The strategy of the team led by Weisser, at least up until now, has been to<br>
                                        eliminate the less profitable brands from Santista Alimentos. Some products<br>
                                        have also bee redirected to large institutional clients, such as bakeries.<br>
                                        “Publicity efforts are not needed in order to serve this market,” says analyst/<br>
                                        Luciana, from Itaú. “What is important is volume. And Bunge understands
                                        volume.”<br>
                                        The idea is to integrate Santista more and more into Bunge Foods, Bunge’s<br>
                                        Food Company in the United States, which does not have consumer brand<br>

                                            to create synergy between the two operations.<br>
